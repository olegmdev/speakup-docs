SpeakUp Api is based on `REST <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>`_.
All Api responses return `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_.

To show example of rest methods we use tool called `httpie <https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#installation>`_.
So make sure it installed if you want to play with examples.
